#can use \ to tell python to treat the next character as part of the string

#Store a string to the variable name

# String Methods
# String objects have a bunch of useful methods that can be used to perform common text manipulation tasks. We will take a look at the most common ones here:

.lower and .upper:# convert the string to all lower or upper case
.strip:# remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the string
.isdigit:# test whether or not the string is a number
.split:# convert a string to a list
.join:# convert a list to a string

#list operators
list.append()
list.pop()


#tuples are Immutable
#Generally used when values are of different data types
#lists are generally used when all values are the same data type
#lists can be changed after creation, tuples can not

#Dictionaries can also be created with the built-in dict function:
dict(name='Codeup', age=4)





#create a dictionary

school = dict(name='Codeup', age=4)

# specifying the dictionary['specifying the value to change'] = code you want to do to edit the dict
# see below

school['age'] + 1
